This is a ReadMe file for Media Queries


Format:
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 425px) {
    ........
}

This format actually works well for the landscape orientation of the PHONE 

OR 

@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 425px) and (orientation: landscape) {
....
}

This format actually works well for the portrait orientation instead of the landscape

TABLETS
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 768px) {
......
}


DESKTOP
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 1080px) {
........
}

NB: START WITH DESKTOP THEN TABLETS BEFORE PHONE

If the max-width was 425px the next min-width should be 426px to another max-width
